## Installation

We believe that everything has to be easy. Not tricky or daunting, Brainy will be the one-to-go package that you will need, from the very first installation to the daily-tasks implementing needs.

### Docker

```
docker build --tag brainy .
```

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name brainy brainy:latest
```

Note that we are assuming that the API's uses port 8080 and that this port will be mapped as 8080 in the host.


### Docker-Compose

docker-compose build
```

After the build process is finished, you can run the container in detached mode:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

If you ever need to perform maintenance or update the repository, please put the container down:
